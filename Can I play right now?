/*

As a strict big brother, I do limit my young brother Vasya on time he spends on computer games. I define a prime-time as a time period till which Vasya have a permission to play computer games. I specify start hour and end hour as pair of integers.

I need a function which will take three numbers - a present moment (current hour), a start hour of allowed time period and an end hour of allowed time period. The function should give answer to a question (as a boolean): "Can Vasya play in specified time?"

If I say that prime-time is from 12 till 15 that means that at 12:00 it's OK to play computer but at 15:00 there should be no more games.

I will allow Vasya to play at least one hour a day.

function canIPlay(now,start,end) {
 if (end <= start) {
    end += 24;
    if (now < start) {
      now += 24;
    }
  }
  return now >= start && now < end ? true : false
}
