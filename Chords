/*

In Western music, a major chord (major third) starts at a root note and adds the note 4 semitones and 7 semitones above it.

A minor chord (minor third) starts at a root note and adds the note 3 semitones and 7 semitones above it.

Given a root note root, please return an array of the major chord and the minor chord for that root.

The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B –– you are given this as a constant

For a music theory kata from a different point of view (figuring out whether a given set of notes is a major chord or minor chord or neither), try this kata from aniametz.
