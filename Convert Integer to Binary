/*

Convert integers to binary as simple as that. You would be given an integer as a argument and you have to return its binary form. To get an idea about how to convert a decimal number into a binary number, visit here.

Notes: negative numbers should be handled as two's complement; assume all numbers are integers stored using 4 bytes (or 32 bits) in any language.

Your output should ignore leading 0s.

Examples (input --> output):
3  --> "11"
-3 -->"11111111111111111111111111111101"
