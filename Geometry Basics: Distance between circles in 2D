/*

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have x, y attributes. Circle objects have center which is a Point, and radius which is a number.

Write a function calculating distance between Circle a and Circle b.

If they're overlapping or one is completely within the other, just return zero.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places, so you don't need to round them yourselves.

function distanceBetweenCircles(a, b){
  const num = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a.center.x - b.center.x,2) + Math.pow(a.center.y - b.center.y,2));
    return num - a.radius - b.radius <= 0 ? 0 :  num - a.radius - b.radius;
}
