/*

You are given a string of words and numbers. Extract the expression including:

the operator: either addition ("gains") or subtraction ("loses")
the two numbers that we are operating on
Return the result of the calculation.

Notes:

"loses" and "gains" are the only two words describing operators
No fruit debts nor bitten apples = The numbers are integers and no negatives
Examples
"Panda has 48 apples and loses 4"  -->  44
"Jerry has 34 apples and gains 6"  -->  40
Should be a nice little kata for you :)

  const operation =  string.split(' ').filter(el=>el.match(/loses|gains/g)).join``;
  const nums = string.split(' ').filter(el=>el.match(/\d/g));
  return operation === 'loses' ? nums.reduce((a,c)=> a - +c) : nums.reduce((a,c)=> a + +c, 0)
