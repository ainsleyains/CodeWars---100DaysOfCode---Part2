Task
Your task is to find the smallest number which is evenly divided by all numbers between m and n (both inclusive).

Example
For m = 1, n = 2, the output should be 2.

For m = 2, n = 3, the output should be 6.

For m = 3, n = 2, the output should be 6 too.

For m = 1, n = 10, the output should be 2520.

Input/Output
[input] integer m
1 ≤ m ≤ 25

[input] integer n
1 ≤ n ≤ 25

[output] an integer
