/*

Given a list of integers, find the positive difference between each consecutive pair of numbers, and put this into a new list of differences. Then, find the differences between consecutive pairs in this new list, and repeat until the list has a length of 1. Then, return the single value.

The list will only contain integers, and will not be empty.

For example:

differences([1, 2, 3]) => [1, 1] => [0] -> 0
differences([1, 5, 2, 7, 8, 9, 0]) => [4, 3, 5, 1, 1, 9] => [1, 2, 4, 0, 8] => .. => 1
differences([2, 3, 1]) => [1, 2] => [1] => 1


*/


function differences(a) {
  if (a.length === 1) {
    return a[0];
  }
  
 let arr = a.map((el, i) => Math.abs(el - a[i + 1])).slice(0, -1);

  return differences(arr);
}
