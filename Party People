Ava, Mark, Sheila, and Pete are at a party. However, Ava and Sheila are only staying if there are at least 4 people, Pete is only staying if there's at least 1 person, and Mark is only staying if there are at least 5 people. Therefore, Mark leaves, which makes Ava and Sheila leave, and Pete is left alone.

Given an array with the preferences of every person at a party for the minimum number of people present, determine how many people will stay.

Examples
[4, 5, 4, 1] ➞ 1
# Ava's minimum number is 4, Mark's is 5, Sheila's is 4, and Pete's is 1.
# Only 1 person (Pete) stays.

[10, 12, 15, 15, 5] ➞ 0

[2, 1, 2, 0] ➞ 4
Notes
All attendees are included in the array.
Any person's count includes themself.
Expect valid input only.
0 <= len(lst) <= 10^5
