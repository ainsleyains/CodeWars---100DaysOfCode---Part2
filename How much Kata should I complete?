/*

I have a competition with my uncle on Codewars. So I want to be at least on the same level as he is.

I am learning how to solve Katas and become better with each kyu.

In this Kata imagine that I can solve only Katas from my own level or lower (kyu level). Return the minimum of Katas number that I have to solve to get at least the same score. Also my score is equal to start of my kyu's score.

INPUT
function howMuchTo( score, current )

score - my uncle's score. (0 <= score <= 250000)
current - my current kyu. (String in format "(kyu|dan)_N", where 1 <= N <= 8)
OUTPUT
The number of Katas I have to solve to get at least given score.

Useful info
You can check this on Codewars Wiki but I'll preload 2 objects: solvingScore with data about getting score for each Kata level and requiredScore with data about required score for promotion.

On 1-2 dan level I continue completing 1 kyu Katas.

function howMuchTo(score, current) {
    let numKata = parseInt(current.match(/\d/g));
  let temp = 0;
  let result = 0;
  
  if (current.includes("dan")) {
    temp = requiredScore["dan_" + numKata];
  } else {
    temp = requiredScore["kyu_" + numKata];
  }
  
  while (temp < score) {
    if (temp >= requiredScore["kyu_" + (numKata - 1)]){
      numKata--;
    }
    
    temp += solvingScore[numKata];
    result += 1;
  }
  
  return result;
}
