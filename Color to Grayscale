/*

Grayscale colors in RGB color model are colors that have the same values for Red, Green and Blue. For example, #606060 is a grayscale color, while #FF0055 is not.

In order to correctly convert a color to grayscale, one has to use luminance Y for Red, Green and Blue components. One can calculate luminance Y through the formula introduced in the NTSC standard:

Y = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B
This formula closely represents the average person's relative perception of the brightness of red, green, and blue light.

Given a color in 6-digit hexidecimal notation #RRGGBB in upper case, convert it to grayscale #YYYYYY. The answer should be a string representing the color code in 6-digit hexidecimal notation in upper or lower case.

Round the value of luminance Y to the closest integer.

All inputs will be valid.

  let r = parseInt(color.slice(1,3),16) /255;
  let g = parseInt(color.slice(3,5),16) / 255;
  let b = parseInt(color.slice(5,7),16) /255;
  let grayscale = Math.round((0.299 * r + 0.587 * g + 0.114 * b) * 255).toString(16).padStart(2,'0');
  return `#${grayscale}${grayscale}${grayscale}`
