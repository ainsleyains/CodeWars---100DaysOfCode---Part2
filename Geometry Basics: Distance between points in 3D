This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have x, y, and z attributes. For Haskell there are Point data types described with record syntax with fields x, y, and z.

Write a function calculating distance between Point a and Point b.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places. Tests in Haskell will not round.
