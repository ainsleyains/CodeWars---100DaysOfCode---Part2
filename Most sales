You work in the best consumer electronics corporation, and your boss wants to find out which three products generate the most revenue. Given 3 lists of the same length like these:

products: ["Computer", "Cell Phones", "Vacuum Cleaner"]
amounts: [3, 24, 8]
prices: [199, 299, 399]
return the three product names with the highest revenue (amount * price).

Note: if multiple products have the same revenue, order them according to their original positions in the input list.


*/


function top3(products, amounts, prices) {
  return products.map((el,i)=>({el,i,revenue:amounts[i] * prices[i]})).sort((a,b)=>b.revenue - a.revenue || a.i - b.i)
                 .slice(0,3).map(product=>product.el)
}
