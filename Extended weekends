If the first day of the month is a Friday, it is likely that the month will have an Extended Weekend. That is, it could have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays.

In this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return:

- The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend
- The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year.
For example:

solve(2016,2020) = ["Jan","May",5]. //The months are: Jan 2016, Jul 2016, Dec 2017, Mar 2019 and May 2020
More examples in test cases. Good luck!

        const first = new Date(i,m,1)
        const second = new Date(i, m+1, 0);
        if(first.getDay() === 5 && !(second.getDay())){
          arr.push(first.toString().match(/\w+/g)[1])
        }
      }
