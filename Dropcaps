/*

DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.

But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

*should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.

"apple"            => "Apple"
"apple of banana"  => "Apple of Banana"
"one   space"      => "One   Space"
"   space WALK   " => "   Space Walk   " 
Note: you will be provided atleast one word and should take string as input and return string as output.

function dropCap(n) {
  return n.replace(/\S{3,}/g, f=>f.slice(0,1).toUpperCase() + f.slice(1).toLowerCase());
}


//Alternative way
function dropCap(n) {
  return n.split(' ').map(el=>el.length > 2 ? (el.split('').map((ele,i)=> i === 0 ? ele.toUpperCase() : ele.toLowerCase()).join``) : el ).join` `
}
