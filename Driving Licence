/*

The UK driving number is made up from the personal details of the driver. The individual letters and digits can be code using the below information
Rules
1–5: The first five characters of the surname (padded with 9s if less than 5 characters)

6: The decade digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 8)

7–8: The month of birth (7th character incremented by 5 if driver is female i.e. 51–62 instead of 01–12)

9–10: The date within the month of birth

11: The year digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 7)

12–13: The first two initials of the first name and middle name, padded with a 9 if no middle name

14: Arbitrary digit – usually 9, but decremented to differentiate drivers with the first 13 characters in common. We will always use 9

15–16: Two computer check digits. We will always use "AA"
Your task is to code a UK driving license number using an Array of data. The Array will look like

data = ["John","James","Smith","01-Jan-2000","M"];
Where the elements are as follows

0 = Forename
1 = Middle Name (if any)
2 = Surname
3 = Date of Birth (In the format Day Month Year, this could include the full Month name or just shorthand ie September or Sep)
4 = M-Male or F-Female
You will need to output the full 16 digit driving license number.
